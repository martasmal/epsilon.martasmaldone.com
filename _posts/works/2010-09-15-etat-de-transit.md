Transit is a place where people, goods and knowledge of itinerary pass through.
Morocco, by its geographical position, is a transit country for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa wishing to travel to Europe.
Following the tightening of border controls by the European Union, migrants are largely stuck to its doors.
With longer duration of transit, migrants have adapted their project and their daily to the Moroccan realities, keeping the hope of starting.
